## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a series of database projects that cover various topics and concepts related to database management systems. Each project folder contains the necessary files and documentation to understand and implement the project.

## Projects

Here is a detailed overview of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: Introduction to SQL**
   - **Description**: This project introduces the basics of Structured Query Language (SQL). It covers fundamental SQL queries such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, along with simple data manipulation and retrieval operations.

2. **Project 2: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
   - **Description**: In this project, you will design Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to model the structure of databases. You will learn how to identify entities, attributes, and relationships between entities, and represent them graphically using ERD notation.

3. **Project 3: Microsoft Access Database**
   - **Description**: This project involves creating and managing a database using Microsoft Access. You will learn how to define tables, establish relationships, and build forms and reports using the Access interface.

4. **Project 4: DDL and Constraints**
   - **Description**: The focus of this project is on Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and constraints in SQL. You will learn how to create and modify database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and define integrity constraints to enforce data integrity.

5. **Project 5: SQL SELECT, Arithmetic Operations, Comparison Operators**
   - **Description**: This project covers advanced SQL SELECT queries involving arithmetic operations, comparison operators, and logical expressions. You will learn how to retrieve and manipulate data from single or multiple tables based on specific criteria.

6. **Project 6: SQL Single Row Functions**
   - **Description**: In this project, you will explore SQL single-row functions for data manipulation. These functions operate on single rows of data and perform calculations, conversions, and string manipulations to generate output based on input values.

7. **Project 7: SQL Joins**
   - **Description**: Understanding SQL joins is essential for querying data from multiple tables. This project provides hands-on experience with various types of SQL joins such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN to combine related data from different tables.

8. **Project 8: SQL Subqueries**
   - **Description**: Subqueries, also known as nested queries, are queries nested within another SQL statement. This project focuses on working with SQL subqueries to retrieve data from nested queries and perform complex data analysis and filtering.
